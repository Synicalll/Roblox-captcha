# Roblox-captcha

## How to use it
This is my captcha source for roblox, it works using the browser PostMessage API to send the captcha token from the IFrame to the page.

It is overly complicated, yes. But it makes implementation alot easier.

page.html - Is the file the captcha will be loaded on
captcha.php - Captcha source page.html points to it.
